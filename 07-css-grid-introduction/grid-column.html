            <h2>Happy Little Layout</h2>
            <div class="col">
                <p>I love to make trees. Truly the joy of painting is the friends that you make doing it. It takes a very, very little bit. Scary to have this much power -- that you can move mountains! Enough of that.</p>
                <p>Everybody will see nature through different eyes Just sorta let this brush dance and play and have fun. Begin laying in just some beautiful little highlights. How beautifully it works! Now things are going to start happening.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <p>Get a nice, even distribution of paint all through the bristles. I may have to go find my old mukluks and put 'em on! That blue is so strong, it'll eat up your whole world in a heartbeat. If you've been in Alaska for less than a year, you're a cheechako! In the woods, you have all different colors of green.</p>
                <p>Hit it, and get away from it. The cloud needs a little friend. There's nothing worse than an angry tree. Each time you do it, you learn from it -- you progress! I like big trees.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <p>Mix it up, just like you're making a cake or something. We're gonna have a light source right in here. I think we'll put a happy little cloud up in the sky. Today, I want softness in our world... tranquility, quiet, peaceful. We'll blend it all together.</p>
                <p>Let me put a little on the other side too, we don't want it to feel left out. Clouds could very well be the freest things in nature. Even a tree needs a friend. Nothing to it. A lot of things happening right here.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Special Image Column -->
            <div class="col col-img">
                <img src="img/penguins.avif" alt="A group of King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) standing together in their natural habitat.">
            </div>

            <div class="col">
                <p>Just walk right back into this painting. I want some happy little things happening up here in the sky. See how easy that is? Gently, gently, gently blend that together. I think we'll just do a happy little picture today.</p>
                <p>Where are we going with this? Don't want to destroy, just diffuse. Quiet, quiet little bushes. We don't care. Don't be afraid of it.</p>
